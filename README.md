**WARNING:** using this could get your discord account banned, as it is classed as **self-botting** which is against Discord's TOS - please use at your own risk, or use on an alt account for precaution.

install discord.py:
```sh
# Linux/macOS
python3 -m pip install -U discord.py

# Windows
py -3 -m pip install -U discord.py
```

explanations are all in `run.py` - you can download the program through [releases page](https://github.com/dromzeh/discord-custom-stream-status/releases/tag/v1)
once you have edited run.py, go into cmd prompt in that directory and write `py run.py`

**DISCLAIMER: I am not responsible if your account gets banned due to using this program, like stated, use at your OWN risk.**

also, to the script kiddies, this isn't a token grabber, it needs your token to run.. how else is it supposed to log in your account without a token lol
